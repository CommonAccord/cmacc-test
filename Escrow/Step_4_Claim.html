<p>Dear Gerry&#39;s Grapes:</p>
<p>This will inform you that on 2014-08-15, Fabulous Express, Inc. delivered package S-98765 to me. The contents were sent by you and described as:</p>
<p>eighteen cases of grape preserves.</p>
<p>This notifies you and the Escrow Agent under the terms of our Escrow Agreement dated 2014-08-13 of my &quot;Claim.&quot;</p>
<p>The Claim is:
Three cases were of the wrong type and one case had three broken jars that leaked on the packaging.</p>
<p>I would appreciate it if you would remedy this problem by:</p>
<p>Two new cases of grape preserves.</p>
<p>Your response is required by two business days.</p>
<p>Role: Purchaser</p>
